🌷 Wimbledon Village HOA — Spring Newsletter
Hello Neighbors!
As we welcome the warmer days of spring, we’re excited to share what’s blooming in our community.

🌼 Spring Cleanup
Join us on April 15th for our annual community cleanup event! We’ll be planting flowers, mulching common areas, and picking up litter to keep our neighborhood beautiful. Volunteers of all ages are welcome — meet at the clubhouse at 9 AM.

🏊 Pool Opening
Our community pool will officially open on May 20th. Please review and sign the updated pool rules prior to your first visit to ensure a safe and enjoyable season for everyone.

💡 Maintenance Updates
New energy-efficient lighting will be installed along the main walking paths this spring. Please watch for temporary closures and signage during the installation period.

🌿 Landscaping Reminders
Spring is a great time to refresh your home’s exterior! Please keep lawns mowed, shrubs trimmed, and flower beds tidy. Together, we can keep Wimbledon Village looking its best.

Thank You!
We appreciate your support in making Wimbledon Village a welcoming and beautiful place to live. As always, feel free to reach out to the HOA board with any questions or suggestions.

See you around the neighborhood!
